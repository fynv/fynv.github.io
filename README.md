##  Web Browser + Game Engine: Combining 2 Monsters

In Metaverse development, it is becoming more and more crucial to have both modern web and modern graphics technologies working collaboratively in the same application.

My opinion is that it is best we can combine a web browser with a game engine at native level. 

This article tries to discuss why the 2 monsters should be and can be combined togther, and what are the current difficulties. By sharing my experience, I also want to persuade more people to join me to try to make it happen.

## Programming GPU across the Language Boundaries

This article tries to illustrate the fact that NVRTC + dynamic-instantiation can be a powerful
CUDA programming paradigm for building GPU libraries that can be reused from an arbitary 
language that supports C/C++ interop. 

This has been the motivation of my "NVRTC Based GPU libraries" series of projects.

## Ray Tracing - What GPU Solves and Doesn't Solve

As I quited NVIDIA recently, now I have more freedom of talking about not just the positive sides of GPUs.
