## Programming GPU across the Language Boundaries

This article tries to illustrate the fact that NVRTC + dynamic-instantiation can be a powerful
CUDA programming paradigm for building GPU libraries that can be reused from an arbitary 
language that supports C/C++ interop. 

This has been the motivation of my "NVRTC Based GPU libraries" series of projects.

## Ray Tracing - What GPU Solves and Doesn't Solve

As I quited NVIDIA recently, now I have more freedom of talking about not just the positive sides of GPUs.

# My Projects

## VkInline

A Python interface to access the computation/rasterization/ray-tracing functionalities of Vulkan. Can be used for GPU computing and off-screen rendering.
