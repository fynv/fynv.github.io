## Programming GPU across the Language Boundaries

This article tries to illustrate the fact that NVRTC + dynamic-instantiation can be a powerful
CUDA programming paradigm for building GPU libraries that can be reused from an arbitary 
language that supports C/C++ interop. 

This has been the motivation of my "NVRTC Based GPU libraries" series of projects.
